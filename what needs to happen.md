# What needs to be done

- describe shape of grpah (every graph)

> Example: at t = n why spike or drop etc

- explain why first spike positive and second spike negative

# Laws being tested
1.  verify time constant rules: 
    - when t = tau, the capatitor is at 63% total capacity. 
    - when t = 5*tau, the capacitor should be at maximun capacity.

# Definitions

1. tau = R*C

This was created for a AP Physics C E&M Resistor-Capacitor Lab. This is a repo contains the raw csv files captured using an IO-Lab module and its accompiing software. I used python and matplotlib to make PNG graphs for the data which can be found in the `DATA_SAVED_FIG` folder. the source code is `main_data_vis.py` it is not very good and sort of patched together. The raw csv data can be found in the `RC Lab data Raw` folder.
